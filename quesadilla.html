    <p>Quesadillas are a beloved Mexican treat made by folding a tortilla in half and filling it with a generous amount of melted cheese. Traditionally, Oaxaca, Chihuahua, or Manchego cheeses are used, but other cheeses like cheddar or Monterey Jack can also be delicious. For added flavor, you can incorporate a variety of fillings such as grilled meats, saut√©ed vegetables, beans, or salsa. Once filled, the quesadilla is cooked on a griddle or in a skillet until the cheese is gooey and the tortilla is golden brown.</p>
