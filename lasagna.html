        Tips for making the perfect lasagna<br>
        Cook the pasta al dente. Overcooked pasta will become mushy in the lasagna.
Assemble the lasagna in a large baking dish. This will ensure that all of the layers are evenly cooked.
Cover the lasagna with foil for the first half of the baking time. This will help to prevent the top from browning too quickly.
