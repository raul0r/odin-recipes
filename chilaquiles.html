            Chilaquiles is a traditional Mexican breakfast dish, beloved for its comforting and flavorful combination of ingredients. Corn tortillas are cut into triangles and lightly fried until crispy, then simmered in a rich, tangy sauce made from either red or green tomatillos, depending on your preference. The tortillas absorb the sauce, softening slightly while retaining some crunch, creating a delightful texture.

        <p>Chilaquiles are typically garnished with toppings like crumbled queso fresco, Mexican crema, diced onions, avocado slices, and fresh cilantro. For added flavor and protein, shredded chicken or scrambled eggs are often served alongside or on top. This versatile dish is hearty, satisfying, and bursting with vibrant flavors, perfect for starting your day with a touch of Mexican tradition.</p>
